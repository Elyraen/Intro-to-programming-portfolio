# ðŸ§¬DNA Sequence Analysis

This Python script analyzes DNA sequences. It first counts the occurrences of the 
nucleotides 'A', 'C', and 'T' in a given DNA sequence. Then, it checks if a specific sequence, 
"ATGATCAAG," is present in the DNA. Next, it attempts to count how many times "ATGATCAAG" 
appears in the DNA sequence. Finally, it checks if a second DNA sequence is entirely contained within the first one. 
The code is structured into functions for different tasks, and the main function demonstrates the 
usage of these functions on example DNA sequences.
