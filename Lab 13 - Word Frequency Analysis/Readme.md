# ðŸ“–Word Frequency Analysis

The script reads a novella from a file, counts the frequencies of specific words in a case-insensitive manner, 
inverts the resulting dictionary, sorts the inverted dictionary based on its values, and finally prints a table 
showing the letters and their corresponding frequencies in descending order.
