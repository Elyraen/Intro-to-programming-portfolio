# ðŸš¶Random Walks

This Python script creates a visual representation of a random walk inside a rectangular boundary 
using the graphics library. A window is opened, and a point starts at the center. The script then 
generates 10,000 random steps, either -2 or 2 in both the x and y directions, ensuring that the next 
position stays within a defined rectangular region. Lines are drawn to connect consecutive points, 
forming a visual representation of the random walk.
