# ðŸŽ­A Simplified Version of Mastermind

 The player tries to figure out a secret four-letter code randomly chosen from the set 'GBRYPO'. 
 The game allows the player to make guesses, and after each guess, it provides feedback on how 
 many letters in the guess match the correct positions in the secret code. The game continues until 
 the player correctly guesses the code, makes 12 incorrect guesses, or chooses to stop playing.
